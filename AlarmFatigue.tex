\Medicine{Alarm fatigue}{ Patient monitors are bedside medical devices
  that monitor patients that are at risk. 
  {\color{red}If the patient is} currently stable, {\color{red}it helps free}
  the medical staff to attend to the patients whose status is
  critical.  Unfortunately, Patient monitors suffer from signal
  quality issues and tend to generate false alarms at a high
  rate. Over time, this can result in the staff not responding to
  alarms, potentially resulting in great damage to the patient. This
  phenomenon, called {\em alarm fatigue} (or alarm overload) is a
  major problem in hospital care \cite{brief2019top}. See, for example,  \cite{cvach2012monitor,paine2016systematic}, for a review.
  
  Alarm fatigue is a well known issue to medical staff and is considered a threat to patient safety \cite{sendelbach2013alarm,ruskin2015alarm}. There is plenty of published research on reducing false alarm rates using different techniques such as signal quality control \cite{li2012signal,behar2013ecg} and sensor fusion \cite{bai2016sequence,hu2019algorithm}.
