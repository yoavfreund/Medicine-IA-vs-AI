\item {\bf Hau-Tieng Wu} is an associated professor in the Department
  of Mathematics and Department of Statistical Science at Duke
  University. Dr. Wu received his MD from National Yang Ming
  University (Taiwan) in 2003, and PhD in mathematics from Princeton
  University in 2011. The goal of Dr. Wu's research is to improve
  human health by developing rigorous and accurate algorithms
  quantifying human physiological dynamics.  Concretely, he focuses on
  the mathematical and statistical foundation of machine learning
  tools to transform multi-modal physiological wave-forms into
  diagnostically meaningful measures.
\item {\bf Yoav Freund} is a professor in the Department of Computer
  Science and Engineering in the university of California, San
  Diego. He received his PhD. in Computer Science in the University of
  California, Santa Cruz in 1993. He is best known for his Work with
  Robert Schapire on boosting, work for which they recieved the Godel
  prize in 2003 and the Kannelakis Prize in 2004.  His work is in
  machine learning theory and applications. His current focus is
  machine learning algorithms to large scale image data.
