\Medicine{Data Overlad}{Medical instruments are constantly improving
  in their resolution creating more and more data per recording (HT,
  can you give examples?).
  This is compunded by the prolifiration of personal health monitoring
  devices that allow a patient to track their vital signs for weeks at
  a time.

Given sufficient time a HP can extract a lot of information from this
data. However is HP time is more and more restructed s/he is likely to
ignore most of the data, using heuristics developed from personal
experience to find informative nuggets of information in the massive
data. IA can monitor the HP's choices of where to focus and be then
used as a filter of low information data for the same or for other
doctors}
