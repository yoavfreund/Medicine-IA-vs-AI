  Urodynamic studies provide the best bladder and sphincter functional data for urologists to decide how to treat patients at risk for renal damage \cite{abrams2003describing}.  While it has been extensively studied and applied in clinics, the main issue that plagues this field of urodynamics is the lack of precise definition of a detrusor contraction or overactive contraction \cite{abrams2003describing}.
%  
  The lack of a well defined definition is due to the lack of quantitative study from the pathophysiological perspective, so the definition is still based on ``expert opinion''. For example, usually an overactive contraction represents itself as a ``bump'' in the detrusor pressure signal. However, what is the breath and height of a bump should we call it an overactive contraction? How to distinguish a true overactive contraction from an artifact? While there have been several reference information, like abdominal pressure, that could help us identify artifacts, but it can only explain a small portion of them.

  Unsurprisingly, this fundamental issue has led to a significant
  inter-rater disagreement
  \cite{venhola2003interobserver,dudley2018interrater}.
  
  {\color{blue}Another example is the ongoing pandemic, COVID-19 \cite{sohrabi2020world}, while this article is prepared. Back in Jan 2020, when it was first reported in China, nobody had a clue how it will generate damage to human body, not to mention how to treat a patient. All medical practices, ranging from diagnosis to treatment to vaccine were all made based on experience. For example, the quinine and remdesivir were considered potential for hospitalized patients. A lot of data could be collected, but there is a huge gap between the data and what's going on. Knowledge was quickly accumulated in the past few months. For example, we know more about hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and many other candidate drugs; see, for example \cite{sanders2020pharmacologic,goldman2020remdesivir}. However, due to the lack of knowledge, even if there exist some protocols, for example \cite{world2020population,world2020protocol,nakajima2020covid,awad2020perioperative} and several others, there are still many white and unknown details in the overall medical practice.}
