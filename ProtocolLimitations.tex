  \Medicine{Protocol limitation}{

Protocols provide a rigorous method for disseminating best practices
in medicine. In essence a medical protocol is a detailed procedure,
recipe, or algorithm for treating a particular disease.

Protocols are usually formulated by committees of experienced
  healthcare providers.  The dissemination of protocols
  unifies and standardizes the medical workflow. This standardization
  reduces errors, enhances reproducibility and
  defines a standard of care.
  
However, protocols are made to be read an interpreted by caregivers,
as such it is extremely hard to make them precise. 
Protocols, being written in a common language, such as
English, french or mandarin, are inherently imprecise and can be understood
differently by different doctors, This can lead to inconsistent diagnosis.

For example, consider sleep analysis. A detail sleep profile is
critical for sleep quality enhancement, or even medical condition
improvement.
The American Academy of Sleep
  Medicine (AASM) publishes criteria for manual sleep stage and sleep
  apnea annotation from the gold standard sleep study instrument, the
  polysomnogram (PSG). This annotation is based on manual analysis of
  biosignals recorded from the PSG \cite{Iber2007,berry2012aasm}. The
  AASM is a protocol that has been extensively applied, with rigorous
  scientific support, and updated regularly according to the latest studies.

However, it is well known that even with a well established
  protocol, the inter-rater agreement rate of sleep stage annotation
  among experts, in terms of percentage of
  epoch-by-epoch agreement, is only about 76\% over normal subjects
  and about 71\% over subjects with sleep apnea, while the Cohen's
  kappa is 65\% over normal subjects and about 59\% over subjects with
  sleep apnea \cite{norman2000interobserver}. Among many reasons, the
  one that is directly related to the intelligent system development
  is how the criteria are defined in the protocol.

For example,
  it is described in the protocol that if the delta wave occupies more
  than 20\% of a given 30-second epoch of the electroencephalogram
  during sleep, that 30-second epoch is defined to be the N3 stage. However, the determination of the duration of delta wave is subjective.
  It is up to the sleep
  expert to make a
  decision based on their experience or other information they have at
  hand. 
  
  Another protocol limitation is
  ``extrapolation error'' which  occurs when a protocol that was
  developed based on studies in one population is applied to a very
  different population~\cite{brosnan2015modest}. Developing protocols
  that can be applied world-wide requires careful experimental design
  to ensure that samples are representative of world
  population.~\cite{venhola2003interobserver}.
