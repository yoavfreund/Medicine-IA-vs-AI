\ML{Skin cancer diagnosis using Deep Neural Networks}{One of the
  papers that provided evidence that deep neural networks might be
  able to outperform humans is the work of Esteva et
  al~\cite{esteva2017dermatologist}. They trained a Deep neural
  network to classify images of skin into three categories: benign,
  malignant and non-cancerous. The network was then tested, along with
  twenty five dermatologists on images which were labeled by a
  pathologist analysis of the biopsy. The neural network performed
  comparably to, and sometimes better than the human dermatologist.
  To provide ground truth, the patients were biopsied and the piopsies
  were diagnosed by pathologists.
