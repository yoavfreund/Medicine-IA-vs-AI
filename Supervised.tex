\ML{Supervised Learning and ground truth}{Roughly speaking, machine
  learning (ML) can be divided into {\em unsupervised} learning and
  {\em supervised} learning. In both, the task of the learning
  algorith is transform a set of {\em examples} into a {\em model}. In
  unsupervised learning the examples are undifferentiated raw
  measurements. In {\em supervised} learning, which is the focus of
  this article, each example consists of an {\em input} and a {\em
    label}. Typically, the labels are provided by a human
  expert. These labels define the {\em ground truth} and the goal of
  the learning algorithm is to make predictions that diverge as little
  as possible from the ground truth.}
