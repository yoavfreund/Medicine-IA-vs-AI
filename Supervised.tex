\ML{Supervised Learning and ground truth}{Roughly speaking, machine
  learning (ML) can be divided into {\em unsupervised} learning and
  {\em supervised} learning. In both cases, the task of the learning
  algorithm is transforming a set of {\em examples} into a {\em model}. In
  unsupervised learning, the examples are undifferentiated raw
  measurements. In supervised learning, which is the focus of
  this article, each example consists of an {\em input} and a {\em
    label}. Typically, the labels are provided by human
  experts.

\yoav{Ground truth is centeral to our comparison with AI and to our
criticism of the DNN papers}

These labels \sout{\color{red}are usually viewed
  as}\sout{define} correspond to the {\em ground truth} and the goal of
  the learning algorithm is to make predictions that diverge as little
  as possible from the ground truth.}
