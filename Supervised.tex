\ML{Supervised Learning and ground truth}{Roughly speaking, machine
  learning (ML) can be divided into {\em unsupervised} learning and
  {\em supervised} learning. Deep learning method are mostly (but not exclusively) a special case of supervised learning.
  
  The task of the learning
  algorithm, in both supervised and unsupervised learning, is transforming a set of 
  {\em examples} into a {\em model}. In
  unsupervised learning, the examples are unlabeled raw
  measurements. In supervised learning each example consists of an {\em input} and a {\em
    label}. Typically, the labels are provided by human
  experts.
These labels are viewed as the ground truth and the goal of
  the learning algorithm is to make predictions that diverge as little
  as possible from the ground truth.}
