\ML{Arrhythmia classification using Deep
  Neural Networks}{Another paper supporting the clam that that deep
  neural networks can outperform humans is the work of
  Hannun et al~\cite{hannun2019cardiologist}. They trained a deep
  neural network to classify single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) into 12 rhythm
  classes, including ten arrhythmias, normal sinus rhythm and noise.

Classifying single-lead ECG recordings is a challenging task even for
experienced cardiologists inter-rater agreement is low. Unlike~\cite{esteva2017dermatologist}
there is no simple way to objectively measure ground truth. Instead, 
Hannun et al relied on {\em consensus committees} among cardiologists to define the ground truth on the test set.

A consensus committee deliberates on each recording until they reach a concensus
classification. Two comments are in order: first, the committee cannot say "We don't know", second, this type of consensus is very different
from perfect agreement in an inter-rater agreement study in which each
diagnostician have to commit to a diagnosis independently, without
communicating with others.


The authors showed that the DNN outperforms 6
  individual board-certificated cardiologists {\em outside the committee}.
  While this result is impressive, it is not clear whether the success
  can be attributable to the DNN. A different interpretation is that
  consensus committees make classifications that are significantly different from
  those of individual cardiologists. While it stands to reason that
  consensus committees are usually {\em better} than individual cardiologists,
  the lack of true ground truth makes the last claim hard to verify.
