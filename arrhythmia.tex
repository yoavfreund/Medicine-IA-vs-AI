\ML{Arrhythmia detection using Deep
  Neural Networks}{One of the papers that provided evidence that deep
  neural networks might be able to outperform humans is the work of
  Esteva et al~\cite{esteva2017dermatologist}. They trained a deep
  neural network to classify electrocardiogram (ECG) into 12 rhythm
  classes. The network was then tested, along XXX. The neural network
  outperformed the human cardiologists. This result is
  impressive. This work is also based on a retrospective analysis. To
  predict the performance of the trained DNN XXX.}
