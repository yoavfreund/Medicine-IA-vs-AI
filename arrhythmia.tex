\ML{Arrhythmia detection using Deep
  Neural Networks}{One of the papers that provided evidence that deep
  neural networks might be able to outperform humans is the work of
  Hannun et al~\cite{hannun2019cardiologist}. They trained a deep
  neural network to classify single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) into 12 rhythm
  classes, including ten arrhythmias, normal sinus rhythm and noise. In this study, the authors prepared a homemade database consisting of single-channel ECG, and this database is much larger than the publicly available database.

  While it is not an easy job to identify different types of arrhythmias from a single-channel ECG signal, even for experienced cardiologists, the cardiologist consensus committee was formed to achieve a gold standard label.

  With gold standard labels determined by a cardiologist consensus meeting, the authors showed that the DNN outperforms 6 board-certificated cardiologists outside the committee. This result is
  impressive. The authors showed the potential of DNN in learning the unified consensus labels and emphasized the weakness of cardiologists when reading the single-channel ECG signal.

  However, the system is assuming that the consensus committee could correctly decide all arrhythmias from the single-channel ECG, instead of saying IDK. }
